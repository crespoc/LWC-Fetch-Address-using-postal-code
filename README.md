Postal Code Finder LWC
This Lightning Web Component (LWC) provides an interactive postal code search feature that displays location data on a map. It retrieves data from an external API based on the entered postal or zip code and marks the locations on a map within Salesforce.

Features
Postal Code Search: Enter any valid postal code to find associated locations.
Map Display: Locations related to the postal code are displayed as markers on a map.
Interactive Markers: Each marker displays information about the location, including area name and postal code.
API Integration: Connects to an external postal API to retrieve location data.
Components
Template (HTML)
lightning-input: A search field for entering the postal/zip code.
lightning-button: Button to trigger the search and display locations on the map.
lightning-map: Map component that displays the locations retrieved.
JavaScript Controller (JavaScript)
Fetches data from the postal API and processes it into map markers.

Dynamically updates map markers and displays feedback messages based on API response.
Installation

Usage
Open the Postal Code Finder component in your Salesforce Org.
Enter a valid postal code in the search box and click Search.
The map will display markers with location details related to the postal code.
Configuration
The component relies on the API https://api.postalpincode.in/pincode/. Ensure that this API is accessible and provides location data for your target regions.
You can modify the zoom level and map view settings directly in the JavaScript file.
Error Handling
If the postal code is invalid or data is not found, the component displays a toast message with the error information.
If the postal code field is left empty, the component prompts the user to enter a valid postal/zip code.
